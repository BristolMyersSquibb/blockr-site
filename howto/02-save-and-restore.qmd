# Save and restore workflows

Learn how to save and restore workflows in blockr.
Let's start with a simple workflow where we visualise some penguins data using three blocks:

## Steps

1. You can rename your workflow by editing the top-left corner text box.
Alternatively, you can stick with the randomly generated default name.

2. Hit the save button to save the current state of your workflow.

3. Next, let's make some changes to your workflow.
Here, let's add a second plot:

4. Then, hit save again to save the new state of your workflow.

5. Now, to restore a previous version of our workflow the first thing we need to do is open the workflow manager.
To do this, press the workflow button in the top-left corner:

6. From here, press the history tab to open a list of all saved versions of our penguins dashboard.
Each save point is an item in the list, with a timestamp of when it was saved.

7. Let's press the first time stamp (here labelled 1 min ago) to restore out previous version of the workflow:

8. Alternatively, press the "View all versions" button to bring up the version history manager which provides you even more control of version restoration and deletion:

9. Finally, let's change our workflow completely by using the C02 dataset instead of penguins and save this new workflow:

10. Now we can save and restore different workflows using the workflow tab in the workflow manager.
Like before, these are presented in a timestamped list, and the "View all workflows" button can be pressed to bring up finer-grained controls:
