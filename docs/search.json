    "text": "This tutorial will get you started with blockr in just a few minutes. By the end, you will have built your first data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest way to try blockr is for free in our live playground at blockr.cloud. Note, you will not be able to save and restore sessions this way.\n\n\n\nRun the following commands to install blockr locally and then spin up an empty app:\ninstall.packages(\"blockr\") # Download blockr. This only needs to be run once.\nblockr::run_app() # Start an empty app. Run this each time you want to boot up blockr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInstalling blockr locally assumes you already have R installed on your system and are comfortable running basic R commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach empty blockr app starts with a blank canvas:\n\nTo build a workflow, simply add some blocks to your canvas, connect them, and then watch blockr automatically run the workflows!\nLet’s start by adding some data. Right-click the canvas then click “Add block”:\n\nThis opens the right sidebar with a block selection menu. Here, blocks are sorted into categories like Inputs, Outputs, and Plots, so you can easily browse and discover them. You can also use the search bar to find blocks.\nFor now, let’s click “dataset block” to load an example data block, preconfigured with a bunch of different datasets.\n\nOnce the block is added to the canvas, the contents of the block will be loaded to the right-hand panel. Let’s change the dataset to penguins by clicking and searching in the drop-down menu:\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s filter our penguins data to only return the species “Adelie” and “Chinstrap”.\nTo connect a filter block:\n\nHover the mouse over the dataset block\nClick the “+” button at the bottom of the block, called a port, to bring up the block menu sidebar once more:\nSearch for “filter” and click “Filter Rows”\n\n\nThis will add a new connected filter block to the canvas. From here, we can filter the data to just keep the “Adelie” and “Chinstrap” species of penguins by seleting their values from the “Values” drop-down box:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s finish our first pipeline by visualising some data. To do that, let’s add a visualisation block, but use a different method to do that.\nFirst, right-click anywhere in the canvas and click “Add block” like we did in the first step of this tutorial:\n\nThen search for “plot” and click “ggplot” to add a plot block to our canvas:\n\nThis will add an unconnected plot block to our canvas. We know that the block is unconnected because there are no connecting arrows from our other blocks to our plot block:\n\nTo connect the plot block, hover the mouse over the filter block to view the available ports. Then, click and drag from the port on the bottom of the filter block to the port on the top of the plot block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice how the dotted line around the port on the plot block becomes solid to indicate that a connection can be made.\n\n\n\nTo finish let’s populate some of the inputs in the plot block to create a scatter plot of penguin bill length versus bill depth across the different species:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it! You’ve learned how to add blocks to the canvas, search for blocks, and connect them using ports. You now have the skills to import, transform, and visualize data in blockr.",
