    "text": "In this tutorial you will learn how to transform a blockr workflow into a dashboard you can share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis tutorial will use the data workflow created in the Getting Started tutorial. Make sure to complete that tutorial first before proceeding with this one.\n\n\n\n\nYou can drag and drop windows to customize your workspace however you like. You can move them around, organize them into tabs, remove them, and resize them. Let’s see how each of these features work:\n\n\nTo move a window, grab the grey tab at the top and drag it wherever you like.\nLet’s start by dragging the plot block down underneath the dataset and filter blocks. As you drag a window, you’ll see a purple highlight showing where it will go when you drop it.\nLet’s move the plot block below the dataset and filter blocks to see how this works:\n\nOnce moved your app should now look like this:\n\nNext, let’s move the filter block to the left:\n\nYour app should now look like this:\n\n\n\n\nYou can also group windows into tab groups. To do this, simply drag a tab next to another tab to group them together.\nFor instance, let’s move the dataset block from the tab group on the right to the tab group on the left:\n\nYou should now see the dataset block is in the left tab group:\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you may wish to just remove a window all together. To do this, just click on the “x” next to the window name in the tab.\nFor instance, let’s remove the dataset window, as it might not be much use to see in our dashboard:\n\nIf you want to reverse this, you can also click the “+” button to add a window back into your app:\n\nBut for now, let’s leave the dataset block removed.\n\n\n\nAt this point your app should have the graph of blocks on the left, the filter block in the middle, and the plot block on the right. Each window should take up approximately the same width:\n\nTo create more space for our filter and plot blocks, let’s resize their windows. To do this, just drag the edge of the respective window to change its size:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo finish creating our dashboard, we’ll customize what users can see and interact with by controlling the visibility of different parts of our app.\n\n\nEach block has two components:\n\nInputs – the controls for a block\nOutputs – the return values (such as data or a plot)\n\nInside each block, you’ll see inputs and outputs separated by a faint grey line:\n\n\n\n\nYou can show or hide inputs and outputs using the “Input” and “Output” buttons located in the top-right corner of each block:\n\nBy default, all inputs and outputs are visible. To change this, simply click the input or output buttons to toggle the respective component on or off.\n\n\n\nLet’s toggle the output “off” for our filter block and the input “off” for our ggplot block:\n\nYou should now notice two things:\n\nThe output data table for the filter block and the input controls for the plot block are no longer visible\nThe input/output buttons change color to indicate whether their component is shown or hidden\n\nBy hiding the filter outputs and plot inputs, we’ve created a curated dashboard view where we control what users can see and interact with. In this case, users can now adjust the filter values and see the effects on the plot in real time, without being distracted by unnecessary components.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial you learned how to transform your blockr workflow into a polished dashboard by customizing the layout and controlling what users see. You learned how to:\n\nMove windows by dragging tabs to rearrange your workspace layout\nGroup windows into tabs by dragging them next to each other\nRemove windows using the “x” button (and add them back with the “+” button)\nResize windows by dragging their edges to emphasize important components\nToggle inputs and outputs on and off using the buttons in the top-right corner of each block\n\nBy combining these techniques, you created a curated dashboard view that controls what users can interact with and see. You now have the skills to build custom dashboards tailored to your audience. Whether you’re creating an interactive report for stakeholders or a data exploration tool for colleagues, you can design layouts and control visibility to create exactly the experience your users need.",

    "text": "This tutorial will get you started with blockr in just a few minutes. By the end, you will have built your first data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest way to try blockr is for free in our live playground at blockr.cloud. Note, you will not be able to save and restore sessions this way.\n\n\n\nRun the following commands to install blockr locally and then spin up an empty app:\ninstall.packages(\"blockr\") # Download blockr. This only needs to be run once.\nblockr::run_app() # Start an empty app. Run this each time you want to boot up blockr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInstalling blockr locally assumes you already have R installed on your system and are comfortable running basic R commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach empty blockr app starts with a blank canvas:\n\nTo build a workflow, simply add some blocks to your canvas, connect them, and then watch blockr automatically run the workflows!\nLet’s start by adding some data. Right-click the canvas then click “Add block”:\n\nThis opens the right sidebar with a block selection menu. Here, blocks are sorted into categories like Inputs, Outputs, and Plots, so you can easily browse and discover them. You can also use the search bar to find blocks.\nFor now, let’s click “dataset block” to load an example data block, preconfigured with a bunch of different datasets.\n\nOnce the block is added to the canvas, the contents of the block will be loaded to the right-hand panel. Let’s change the dataset to penguins by clicking and searching in the drop-down menu:\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s filter our penguins data to only return the species “Adelie” and “Chinstrap”.\nTo connect a filter block:\n\nHover the mouse over the dataset block\nClick the “+” button at the bottom of the block, called a port, to bring up the block menu sidebar once more:\nSearch for “filter” and click “Filter Rows”\n\n\nThis will add a new connected filter block to the canvas. From here, we can filter the data to just keep the “Adelie” and “Chinstrap” species of penguins by seleting their values from the “Values” drop-down box:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s finish our first pipeline by visualising some data. To do that, let’s add a visualisation block, but use a different method to do that.\nFirst, right-click anywhere in the canvas and click “Add block” like we did in the first step of this tutorial:\n\nThen search for “plot” and click “ggplot” to add a plot block to our canvas:\n\nThis will add an unconnected plot block to our canvas. We know that the block is unconnected because there are no connecting arrows from our other blocks to our plot block:\n\nTo connect the plot block, hover the mouse over the filter block to view the available ports. Then, click and drag from the port on the bottom of the filter block to the port on the top of the plot block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice how the dotted line around the port on the plot block becomes solid to indicate that a connection can be made.\n\n\n\nTo finish let’s populate some of the inputs in the plot block to create a scatter plot of penguin bill length versus bill depth across the different species:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it! You’ve learned how to add blocks to the canvas, search for blocks, and connect them using ports. You now have the skills to import, transform, and visualize data in blockr.",
